Hello!! Welcome to my 322 final project!

The libraries you will need to install (also detailed in the supplemental section of my paper) are:
streamlit, oauth2client, and gspread.


You will need to run the app using the command "streamlit run"


Also, I wasn't super sure what tone to take for the paper. It's meant to be read as formal if you ignore the footnotes and supplemental, but I also wanted to give those details even though they aren't necessarily appropriate for a technical report. 


Anyways, I hope it is fun to explore my project! I am sort of realizing that it is an organizational system that only makes sense to me, someone who has spent a lot of time with the archive. I was hoping that by providing a visual representation, I could make more people follow it.... But I am not actually sure how much of this makes sense outside of my brain or the context of the archive... Even Alex, who has spent a bunch of time running samples from there and who designed the form and supported my matrix idea when I suggested it, said that I would probably end up being the only person who uses this system ahaha. At the very least, I think it was a fun project.
